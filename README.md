# AI Feature Tracker

This project simulates the full product management lifecycle for an AI-powered feature called "AI Background Remover." It includes planning, execution, and performance tracking components.

## What We Built

The project includes the following artifacts and deliverables:
- A structured PRD with user stories and measurable goals
- A frontend demo built with Next.js and a custom Bootstrap-based ShadCN component library
- A Trello-based Agile board for sprint tracking
- A Looker Studio dashboard for tracking usage, latency, and success rate
- A Notion table simulating external AI partner integration tracking

## PM Process

### Define
- Created a [Product Requirements Document (PRD)](./PRD.md)
- Outlined user personas, goals, success metrics, and clear technical requirements

### Build
- Tracked progress and features using [Agile board on Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/6862060e218eb72a3f21d057/ATTI9d91bcebf74e8509ff26b8cca3d4c0e855B46866/ai-feature-lifecycle)
- Developed a frontend demo using Next.js with a custom component design system based on ShadCN and Bootstrap utility classes

### Analyze
- Measured feature usage, latency, and success rate using simulated data
- Created a live metrics dashboard in Looker Studio

### Report
- Shared final links and documentation for reproducibility and demo purposes
