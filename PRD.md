## Goals

- Provide users with a seamless way to remove backgrounds from images
- Integrate the solution into a local/hosted interface
- Track performance: latency, usage, success rate

## Users

- Content creators
- Students making presentation decks
- Remote workers creating professional images

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to upload an image so that I can remove its background easily.
- As a user, I want the result to be shown quickly so I can use it in my project immediately.
